# PDF Summarizer Web Application

This is a web application built using Flask that allows users to upload PDF documents and generate summaries using the Hugging Face BART model. The application provides an easy-to-use interface to summarize the content of uploaded PDF files.

## Features

- Upload PDF documents: Users can upload PDF documents through the web interface.
- BART Model: The application utilizes the Hugging Face BART model to generate text summaries.
- Text Summarization: The uploaded PDF content is processed to extract main ideas, supporting points, plot points, characters, locations, and significant facts.
- User-friendly UI: The web application is designed with a clean and formal UI using CSS to provide a pleasant user experience.

## How It Works

1. Users upload PDF documents through the provided web interface.
2. The uploaded PDF content is processed to extract text using the PyPDF2 library.
3. The extracted text is summarized using the Hugging Face BART model, which employs advanced text generation techniques.
4. The generated summary is displayed to the user on the web interface.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: The web application framework used to create the user interface and handle requests.
- Hugging Face Transformers: The library used to access the BART model for text summarization.
